But is slant height what we need for data processing? *What information on height is included in the RINEX file?*\n",

    "Along with the July 2024 data, and the data you may have collected, I have provided RINEX files of other surveys of VERS. By processing these, and compiling date and east, north and up information, you can build a time series of the change in coordinate of the station, and use that to estimate a velocity for the site $-$ either by making a spreadsheet of the values, or by doing it in a more Pythonic way by building a Pandas table, and using an XML reader to populate it with your processed positions. \n",

    "My suggested order of tasks: process all the data, plot the changes in position over time (maybe subtract the position of the earliest measurement from the others?), fit a trend line to each component and see what you get. Can you plot your estimated velocity on a map (e.g. using psvelo in GMT or pygmt.plot in PyGMT)? Does it make sense?"
