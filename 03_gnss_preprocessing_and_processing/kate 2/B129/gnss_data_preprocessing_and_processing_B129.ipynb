    "Once we have collected some GNSS data, you might want to process it. Before you do that, you will need to convert the data into a processable format, calculate some important metadata parameters, and edit the datafile headers with useful information. This can take longer than processing the data sometimes!\n",

Others, such as the Trimble R7 and Topcon GB-1000, log data to a CompactFlash card within the receiver, which can then be pulled out and read with a card reader at the end of the survey (which is usually much easier to do, especially when out in the field).\n",

    "### 1.3 Estimating antenna height from slant height\n",
    "\n",
    "When collecting GNSS data, some of the key metadata we collect are the heights of the antennas during data collection. In a typical tripod setup, using GNSS antennas with ground planes, these will usually be slant heights from the station marker to the base of the ground plane, measured using a measuring stick.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our protocol is to make three measurements of slant height at different parts of the antenna at equipment set-up and three more at take-down. Assuming that the equipment is not significantly disturbed during the data take, the average of these six measurements is a reasonable estimate of the slant height of the antenna during that data take. But is slant height what we need for data processing? *What information on height is included in the RINEX file?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Each GNSS antenna has a 'reference point' $-$ the point to which all measurements are referenced. For common antennas like those in the Trimble Zephyr Geodetic family, this is typically the base of the antenna. Note that this is not what we measure when setting up our equipment...\n",
    "\n",
    "![diagram of antenna height](./antenna_height.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we turn our slant height measurements to the base of an antenna ground plane into a measurement of the vertical height of the antenna reference point? Pythagoras, with some light subtraction...\n",
    "\n",
    "If $h$ is the desired vertical height of the antenna reference point above the benchmark, $R$ is the measured average slant height to the base of the antenna ground plane, $r$ is the antenna radius and $t$ is the vertical distance between the base of the ground plane and the antenna reference point, then...\n",
    "\n",
    "$$h = \\sqrt{(R^2-r^2)}-t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Seems straightforward! Where do we get the information for $r$ and $t$, I hear you ask? Well, there are a couple of options: 1) the details are included on a sticker attached to the antenna, and 2) if you know the antenna manufacturer, type and part number you can look it up at the NGS's data repository on GNSS antennas, here: https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/ANTCAL/ (look under \"Browse Antenna Information\")"
