But is slant height what we need for data processing? *What information on height is included in the RINEX file?*\n",

    "* -O.mn \\<monument number\\> $-$ if you know the benchmark number, give it here (else give '' to blank it out)\n",
    "* -O.pe \\<h e n\\> $-$ give the antenna height (h), plus east and north offsets (0 0) here\n",

It is remarkably easy to use, and even if you want to do your own 'proper' processing using a package like GAMIT/GLOBK or GIPSY later on, you will get some sense of the quality of your data from the output. \n",

Its results are not as robust as you would obtain from forming a greater number of double-differences from more stations, and it does not work as well in areas where there is a low density of continuous stations, but for southern California, it still works well.\n",
    "\n",
    "To process data with OPUS, you will need three things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a RINEX file with between 2 and 48 hours of data\n",

    "Of course, for the data we have just preprocessed, we know all of those things. (And for properly prepared RINEX files from other people, the necessary information is in the headers.)\n",

    "So, to process your data, simply go to the website, select your RINEX file, select the antenna type, enter the vertical height, and enter your email address. You can optionally choose the format of the output (I usually choose the version that produces an XML file as well, as it may be easier to ingest the results later on).\n",
