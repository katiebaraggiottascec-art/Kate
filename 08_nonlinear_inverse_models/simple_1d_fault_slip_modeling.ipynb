    "\n",
    "Although it is most commonly known as the Savage and Burford model, the 1D model for strike-slip, or more precisely, for a screw dislocation in an elastic half space, was originally derived by Weertman and Weertman (1964). It makes several simplifying assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The fault is vertical\n",
    "- The fault is infinitely long\n",
    "- The fault extends infinitely deep, beneath a locking depth, $D$\n",
    "- The fault is locked above the locking depth\n",
    "- The fault is stably sliding at a constant, uniform rate, $s$, beneath the locking depth\n",
    "\n",
    "The model describes how the surface deformation rate, $v$, varies as a function of distance, $x$, from the fault. (There are also expressions for strain rate, $e$, which are effectively the spatial derivative of v, but we won't get into that today.) That relationship is analytical, and simple to evaluate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ v = \\frac{s}{\\pi} \\arctan\\left(\\frac{x}{D}\\right)+v_{shift}$$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where $v_{shift}$ is a shift in velocity to account for the difference between zero in the model and any overall regional motion (e.g. due to plate tectonics).\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is often associated with Savage and Burford, two researchers from the USGS, who in 1973 published their application of the model to EDM data from the San Andreas fault system in California. The main figure illustrating the model is a classic, and worth reproducing here!\n",

    "The top panel shows the model geometry (left), the theoretical strain rate distribution (center) and expected displacement (or velocity) profile (right). The lower panel shows the same, but for a fault that is stably sliding from the surface (what you would expect if a fault was creeping at its long-term slip rate).\n"
