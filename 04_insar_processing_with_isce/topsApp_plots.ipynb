    "1) **You don't have a `topsApp.xml` file**\n",

    "If you run `topsApp.py` without explicitly naming the xml file that contains all of the configuration and file information, it assumes your file is called `topsApp.xml`. If that doesn't exist, you are not going to get very far.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Your orbit files are missing or wrong**\n",
    "\n",
    "If topsApp can't find appropriate orbit files for your data, it won't know where your SLCs are located in space, and it will probably fail to find any overlap between them, muttering comments about 'bboxes' (bounding boxes, i.e. the extents of the images) as it does so.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Your SLCs don't overlap with each other (or with your bounding box, if you are using one)**\n",
    "\n",
    "If your SLCs legitimately don't overlap, topsApp will crash. If you specify a bounding box (which is an option) and your SLCs don't overlap with *that*, topsApp will crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **It has trouble downloading a digital elevation model**\n",
    "\n",
    "A DEM is essential for geocoding and correcting data for topographic effects. If you are unable to download one (which is an early step in the `topsApp.py`, then something about your setup is wrong $-$ or, you are in a location where the standard DEM is not available (the SRTM DEM that ISCE typically uses is not available north of 60$^\\circ$N or south of 56$^\\circ$S. In any case, your processing will be hosed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) **You have a lot of decorrelation in your data, and it crashes at the ESD step**\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhanced Spectral Diversity, or ESD, is a way of using the diversity of Doppler shifts in the data to estimate a fine, along-track alignment between your SLCs. This will fail if you have too much decorrelation in your data. If that is the case, try to restrict your processing to areas that have less decorrelation, or switch ESD off in your `topsApp.xml` file."
